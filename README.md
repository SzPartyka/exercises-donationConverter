# exercises-donationConverter

Donation converter version 2:

Things changed:
-overall design
-now the project contains two separate sites, one for converter and one for map
-some marks of BEM method were included, mostly to HTML and SCSS/CSS files (see class names)
-bits of redundant code were deleted

Things to change/improve:
-rewriting some parts of code using BEM (map connected files mostly)
-upgrading converter, so it can count other types of donations
-maybe some design corrections
